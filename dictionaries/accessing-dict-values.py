Accessing Dictionary Values
Dictionary elements must be accessible somehow in code, otherwise they wouldn't be very useful.

A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. The square brackets look similar to indexing into a list.

car = {
    "make": "Toyota",
    "model": "Camry"
}
print(car["make"])
# Prints: Toyota
