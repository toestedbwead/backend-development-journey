'''
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries were unordered.

Because dictionaries are ordered, the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, so you couldn't refer to an item by using an index.

The takeaway is that if you're on Python 3.7 or later, you'll be able to iterate over dictionaries in the same order every time.
