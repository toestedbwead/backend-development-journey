# Learning Effectively
This course is about to get a bit harder. There's no way around it, if programming were a walk in the park everyone would be earning 6 figures as a software engineer. But it's not, and to succeed without getting stuck and frustrated, you need to learn how to learn.

# Process for Solving Hard Coding Problems
1. Read the lesson first! Figure out the examples before writing your own code.
2. Read the assignment. Understand the goal of the assignment before you start writing code.
3. Start writing code.
4. Add print() statements. Don't wait until you've written a lot of code to start testing. Add print() statements and use the Run button to see if your code is doing what you expect at each step. It's easier to find issues in small bits of code than in large blocks of code.
5. Keep running, printing, and fixing until you're confident your code is working.
6. Submit your code. If the assignment you're working on has unit tests, no need to remove your debugging print() statements. If the assignment you're working on is testing console output, be sure to remove your print() statements before submitting.
7. Compare your code to the instructor's. You will not be penalized for looking at the solution after you have successfully completed the assignment.
