A New Type of Lesson
Going forward, you'll encounter a new type of lesson: unit tests. A unit test is just an automated program that tests a small "unit" of code. Usually just a function or two. The editor will have tabs: the 'main.py' file containing your code, and the 'main_test.py' file containing the unit tests. The shortcut to switch tabs is typically Alt+Shift+[ on QWERTY keyboards. This shortcut may vary depending on your keyboard layout.

These new unit-test-style lessons will test your code's functionality rather than its output. Our tests will call functions in your code with different arguments, and expect certain return values. If your code returns the correct values, you pass. If it doesn't, you fail.

There are two reasons for this change:

It's more realistic. In the real world, you'll be writing unit tests and running them against your code to make sure it works as expected.
You can run and debug your code with print statements, and leave those print statements in when you submit. Unlike the output-based lessons, you won't have to remove your print statements to pass.
Also, â–¶ Run and â–¶ Submit work a little differently than before. When you run your code, it only runs some of the tests, but when you submit your code, it runs all of the tests. This is to simulate a production environment with unexpected edge cases and to teach you to think them through. Luckily for you, all of the tests are visible in the main_test.py file tab, so be sure to check it before submitting.

Assignment
Complete the total_xp function. It accepts two integers as input:

level
xp_to_add
There are 100 xp per level. total_xp should convert the current level to xp, then add this current xp to the xp_to_add argument and return the player's total xp. For example:

If a player is level 1 and gains 100 xp, they have 200 total xp.
If a player is level 2 and gains 250 xp, they have 450 total xp.
If a player is level 170 and gains 590 xp, they have 17590 total xp
