Assignment
Fix the for loop in the count_down function. It takes start and end inputs, but start is always greater than end. It's supposed to print numbers counting down, beginning at start (inclusive) and stopping just before end (exclusive), but there's a mistake in the range function call.

def count_down(start, end):
    for i in range(start, end, 1):
        print(i)

def test(start, end):

    print(f"Printing numbers from {start} to {end + 1}:")
    count_down(start, end)
    print("=====================================")
