Assignment
When a character in Fantasy Quest is attacked, the strength of the attack is compared to the strength of the character's defensive enchantments. If the character has any enchantment that is at least as strong as the attack, then the attack is blocked and the character takes no damage.

Fix the check_defense function.

It checks each defensive enchantment against the attack. If an enchantment is strong enough, it prints that the attack is blocked. In that case, the loop should stop instead of checking furtherâ€¦ make sure that it does!
